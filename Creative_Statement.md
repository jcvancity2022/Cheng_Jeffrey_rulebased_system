# Creative Statement (Assignment 2)

## Artistic Goals

This project explores **liminal architecture**—spaces that feel familiar yet uncanny—by constructing a resort‑above / mall‑below megastructure through rule‑based geometry. The goal was to create an image that reads as architectural, not illustrative: a conceptual diagram that suggests scale, order, and atmosphere without photorealism.

## Inspiration and Process

The work is inspired by courtyard resorts and layered commercial complexes. The design process emphasized:

- **Hierarchy**: a dominant center mass with folded wings
- **Convergence**: a courtyard‑based perspective that compresses depth
- **Repetition**: bays, slabs, and rhythmic facade elements derived from simple rules

Multiple variations were generated by adjusting rules and parameters—color palette, curvature, wing distortion, and rock texturing—while preserving the overall structural logic of the architectural renderer.

## Reflection

The rule‑based approach produced consistent, legible forms while still allowing stylistic shifts across variations. The most successful results balanced strict geometry with subtle texture, creating a space that feels simultaneously planned and speculative. Future iterations could merge the L‑system linework more directly with the architectural renderer to unify grammar‑driven growth with spatial massing.
